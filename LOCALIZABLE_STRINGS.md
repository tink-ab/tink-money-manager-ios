# Localizable Strings

All strings in the SDK are by default in English. To localize the strings in your app you can provide your own strings by specifying strings for a specific set of keys in a strings file named `TinkMoneyManagerUI`.

For example: To add a Italian translation for the latest transactions title displayed in the financial overview, add `"Tink.Overview.LatestTransactions.Title" = "Ultime transazioni";` to your `it.lproj/TinkMoneyManagerUI.strings` file in your app bundle. 
Then the SDK will use that string instead of the default ones when running on a device that has the language setting set to prefer Italian. 

You can also use the [Xcode Localization Catalog (xcloc)](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev5a03f5aa1), provided in this repo in the `en.xcloc` folder as a basis for adding new translations. For example to send to an external localization service for translations.
